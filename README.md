Wanderful
=========

Overview:

An app to help people travel

Gathers data regarding areas which the user has expressed an interest in and also makes recommendations
based upon criteria which the user will specify

User can set up an autopay which will take an alotted amount of capitol each month and save it on the users
behalf for future travel. (Bitcoin capable)

Will group users into categories based upon their intended destinations and search for cheap group rates, offer
cheaper alternatives, and offer a form of layaway system or monthly installments. User can also specify a budget
which the app will try and accomodate.

Forums and blogs will be accessable to discuss users experiences and whether they would recommend the trip to 
others. Each trip taken will earn the user awards and status within the app

Scope:
I intend to write the code using javascript and perhaps a markup language of some sort. I am in the process of learning
as I go so this ofcourse is subject to change given a more viable alternative is suggested.

I also intend to build a database as well as use other resources from large scale databases which currently exist.
